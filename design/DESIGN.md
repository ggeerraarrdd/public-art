# Design Document

## Scope

The database for Public Art includes all entities necessary to facilitate the documentation of public art. As such, included in the database's scope are:

* Objects, including information on works of art that meet the definition of "public art"
* Installations, including information on the placement of an object on at least one location
* Agents, including information on individuals or groups of individuals that have a relationship to at least one record in at least one entity
* Objects-Agents, including information on the association between object(s) and agent(s)
* Role Types, including information characterizing an object-agent association
* Inscriptions, including information on intentional textual inscription(s) on an object
* Locations, including information on  physical places that have a relationship to at least one record in at least one entity
* Assets, including information on digitized media associated with at least one object
* Asset Types, including information characterizing an asset
* Assets-Objects, including information on the association between asset(s) and object(s)
* Databases, including information on databases where assets are stored
* Assets-Databases, including information on the storage location of digitized copy of an asset
* Rows, including information on a record from select entities
* Attributes, including information on an attribute in a row entity
* Verifications, including information on verification of an attribute entity
* References, including information on sources of information used in a verification entity
* Users, including information on users who can perform CRUD operations on the database

At least in the initial iterations of the database, the following are out of scope:

* The actual assets themselves, since they are to be stored in NoSQL databases.
* Non-factual information about the objects, such as art criticisms, aesthetic interpretations and other forms of opinion writing.
* An object's full provenance. For objects that are temporary installations, the database will only concern itself with information about the installation immediately before and after the current installation, with "current" referring to the installation at the time of its record entry in the database.
* Attributes not selected to undergo a verification process.

## Functional Requirements

This database will support:

* CRUD operations by users
* Tracking assets stored in other databases
* Implementing principle of least privilege
* Verifying select attributes from select entities

Note that the database will not support CRUD operations on the assets, which are saved on other data stores, except on the metadata saved on the database.

## Representation

Entities are captured in Postgres tables with the following schema.

### Entities

The database includes the following entities:

### Relationships

The below entity relationship diagram describes the relationships among the entities in the database.

![ER Diagram](diagram.png)

As detailed by the diagram, here are the most important relationships:

* One object, which refers to a work of art, including all its constituent parts, is part of one to many installations. An installation is comprised of one and only one object.
* An installation is installed in one and only one location. A location contains zero to many installations.
* An installation is preceded by zero to one installation. Similarly, an installation is proceeded by zero to one installation.
* An object is part of one to many object-agent relationship. Similarly, an agent is part of one to many object-agent relationship. An example object-agent relationship is an agent being the lead artistic creator of an object. Another example is an agent being the owner of record for an object.
* An object contains zero to many inscriptions. An inscription is contained in one and only one object.
* An asset is in one to many asset-object relationships. Similarly, an object is in zero to many asset-object relationships. An example asset-object is a video showing an object at an installation.
* The entities object, installation, inscription and object-agent relationship has one to many rows. In practical terms, this means that all their rows have metadata saved on the rows entity.
* A row contains one to many attributes. An attribute is in one and only one row.
* A verification verifies one and only one attribute. An attribute is verified by one and only one verification.
* A reference supports one to many verifications. A verification is supported by one to many references.

## Optimizations

Per the typical queries in `queries.sql`, it is common for users of the database to view records of an object and its current installation. For that reason, indexes are created on the `title`, `title_display` and `title_alt` columns in the `objects` table to speed the identification of objects by those columns.

For that same reason, indexes are also created on the `name`, `name_display` and `name_alt` columns in the `locations` table.

## Limitations

The current schema assumes that an attribute will only need one verification by one user. In other words, it assumes that the user who conducted the verification will have 100% accuracy. If verification requires double checking, then both the attribute-verification and verification-user relationships will have to be many-to-many.

The current schema also assumes that (spatially and/or temporally) separated or separable parts of a work of art (i.e., object) are in an inseparable relationship with each other. In other words, the database assumes all those parts to be an integral part of the object. They may have individual titles, but they do not have their own identify or function independently from the object. Thus, the schema cannot support an object made up of individual items which may be displayed separately in different settings or time by the artist.
