# Public Art API

An open data portal for public art in Chicago

## Description

_Public Art API_ is a planned data portal for comprehensive, fact-based information on public art in Chicago.

It will consist of a `RESTful API` with publicly exposed endpoints and a user-friendly `web app` powered by that API for the general public to interact with the data. The two will be developed separately. That is, the API will be developed using the FastAPI web framework, and the web app using the Flask (or Django) web framework.

The development is kickstarted by the [database design document](design/DESIGN.md) submitted as the final project for [CS50SQL: CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2023/)  (HarvardX, 2023). And much like during the analysis and design process, it will be guided by the following use cases:

* Facilitate on-site and off-site documentation of public art
* Support research, teaching and personal enrichment
* Assist preservation activities

Stay tuned!
